# Flipbook with PDF Upload and Text Input

This project is a web-based application that allows users to upload a PDF file and view it as a flipbook. Additionally, users can enter text into a textarea, which is displayed in a book-like format with pagination. The application provides a seamless experience for viewing both PDFs and text content with a 3D raised effect and interactive features. This application is applicable in creating custom restaurant menu in html 5, create PDF from text, view/compare PDF and text side-by-side. This app will be implemeted as a SAAS platform where users can scan a QR code, and the specific restaurant menu will be displayed.
